#### Overview
This single page application was bootstrapped with Create React App and represents the final 
capstone project for the Full Stack Web Developer program at Practicum. Given that this course
covers the entire stack, [the backend](https://github.com/William-Schutte/news-explorer-api) is 
also part of the project.

#### Techniques
The workflow followed Agile methodology and was broken into 5 stages. Progress and task tracking
was executed with a Kanban board provided by Atlassian Jira software. **Stage 0** required 
preplanning, breaking the project down into tasks, and setting deadlines. **In Stage 1**, I 
developed the backend API and setup the server on an AWS EC2 virtual machine. **Stage 2** 
encompassed the design of the frontend in React from a Figma wireframe, including all visual 
components and page responsivity. All React and JS functionality, including connecting the frontend
with the backend, was handled in **Stage 3**. Lastly in **Stage 4**, I finalized the project,
tweaking and optimizing the application while returning to any features I wasn't quite happy with
or details I may have missed in previous stages. 

#### Technologies
* React/Create React App
* Node.js, NPM
* RESTfull API design
